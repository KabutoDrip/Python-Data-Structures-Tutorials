 # We need to learn the operations of a stack before we can implement them
 They are as Follows;
 * push(x): Place the passed element onto the top of the stack
 * pop(): Remove the top element from the stack
 * size(): Returns the number of items in the stack
 * empty(): Checks if the stack is empty
 * top(): Returns the value of the top element of the stack
